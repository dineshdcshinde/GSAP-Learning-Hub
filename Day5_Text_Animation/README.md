# Text Animation Project üé®‚ú®

This project showcases a **dynamic text animation effect** using **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**. The word "Sheriyans" is split into individual characters, and animations are applied differently based on their position:

- Characters in the class **left half** slide in with a **vertical motion**.
- Characters in the class **right half** slide in with a **horizontal motion**.
- On hover, each character scales up and changes color to vibrant gold (`#FFD700`), contrasting beautifully with the dark background.
