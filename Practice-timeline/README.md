## How It Works

The project leverages GSAP's timeline feature to animate elements in a logical sequence:

1. **Navigation Bar:**
   - Logo slides in from the top with an elastic effect.
   - Navigation items animate sequentially with a staggered effect.
2. **Hero Section Content:**
   - Headline and description slide in from the left.
   - The button scales up with a bounce effect.
   - The image transitions smoothly from the right.
