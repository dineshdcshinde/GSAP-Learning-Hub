# Dynamic SVG Path Animation with GSAP

This project demonstrates a **dynamic SVG path animation** that responds to mouse movements using **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**. It includes a custom cursor effect and an interactive SVG path that reacts to user input in real-time.

## Features

- **Custom Cursor**: A dynamic cursor that follows the user's mouse with an offset.
- **Interactive Path Animation**: The SVG path updates its shape dynamically based on the mouse's position.
- **GSAP Animation**: Smooth transitions and easing effects using GSAP.
- **Responsive Design**: The SVG adjusts to 80% of the screen width and remains centered.

## Learning Goals

As an aspiring web developer, this project helped me learn:

1. How to manipulate SVG paths dynamically using JavaScript.
2. How to use GSAP for smooth animations.
3. Event handling for interactive web elements.
4. Debugging and improving SVG visibility with proper `viewBox`, `width`, and `height` settings.
